# OneForAll-GroceryApp
Dear Developer, Manager and/or Grocery List Friend,  

The Corona crisis confronts us all with new challenges. Elderly people should no longer go outside, suspicious cases must stay at home and we should not meet our friends. Nevertheless, we have to supply ourselves with food, medicine and hygiene articles.   To make shopping as efficient and corona compatible as possible the best is, if one person does the shopping for several households at once - and we should provide a good grocery list app for the person, which 

* Summarizes the grocery lists of the several households in one Summary-List 
* Still keeps the Single-Lists of every household so that the Summary-List can be split again during or after the shopping tour
* Categorizes the products so that the shopping tour and the walk through the supermarket can be planned well 
* On top of that  it would be great if people could create a public account with their location in order to offer or to ask for shopping support  

We, the Team of the One for All Grocery App, would be grateful if you support our idea. The best way to do so is by implementing the befornamed features in your already existing grocery list app!  Please find a detailed problem description attached.   

Best, 
The One for All Grocery App - Team
